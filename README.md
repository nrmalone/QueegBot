# QueegBot: Your New ~~Best~~ *Worst* Friend
### Description
You know what the worst part of having mortal friends is? They're _time-sensitive_!<br>
With **QueegBot**, you'll experience that familiar disappointment but this time without emotional baggage. Both a blessing and a curse, **QueegBot**'s $0 budget and 2 person dev team means that much like some of your human companions, he's only there when he feels like it and he's a dry texter. This means he's not a hotline or free therapy... <sub>unless venting to the brick wall of his DMs that we might occasionally sift through is your definition of therapy</sub><br><br>
Cynicism and joking aside, this is a passion project Discord bot that my little brother and I are developing for our own server, but we might make it a public bot in the future.
